📌 Interview Booking System
📖 Project Overview
Interview Booking System is a full-stack web application that allows candidates to book interview slots and interviewers to manage their availability. The system simplifies the interview scheduling process and reduces manual coordination.
The frontend is developed using Angular and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is built with Spring Boot using Spring Data JPA for database operations. The backend follows a layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository) for better maintainability and scalability.
